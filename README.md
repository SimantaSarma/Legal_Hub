## 🔍 Smart Search Implementation  

The smart search works by:  
1. Searching legal terms in the dictionary database  
2. Searching rights stored in MongoDB  
3. Searching legal forms and their descriptions  
4. Returning combined results in a ranked order  

Example API response for `/api/search?q=tenant rights`:

json
{
  "dictionary_results": ["Tenant Rights - Explanation"],
  "rights_results": ["Right to Safe Housing"],
  "form_results": ["Rental Agreement Form"]
}
`
